First, modify `SOURCE_DIR` in `include/utils/global_config.h` to point to the root directory of the Fern repository.

To build Fern, run the following commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You may need to `brew install ginac` if you don't already have it installed.

Once you have a build, run the following command (in the `build` directory) to run the tests:

```
./test/all_tests
```

This will output the code generated by Fern to the `code_sample/code` directory. Each example generates a `my_fused_impl` function -- you can paste or include this function definition into your own code to use it.
